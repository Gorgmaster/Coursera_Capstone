## Final Project - Battle of the Neighborhoods
-----------------------------------------------------------

## Introduction

Three of the biggest and most wanted cities in the world are Berlin, London and New York.
They are the first cities that come to everybodys mind when you think about diversity and
a place to be. But what do the cities have in common when we talk about possibilities for
free time activities. What can you do after work and what would be a ranking of boroughs to
live to have everything right at your foot step?

This analysis is for a dear friend who has the opportunity to move to one of the three cities and has to decide
which one to choose. This analysis should help him to decide, which city is the most livable city for him.


## Data

Web scraping of Boroughs and Neighborhoods of the three cities from the respective Wikipedia pages.
Use of "Beautifulsoup" as software tool.

Boroughs and Neighborhoods:

Berlin: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boroughs_and_neighborhoods_of_Berlin
London: https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Borough
New York: https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verwaltungsgliederung_von_New_York_City

All data related to venues will be provided through the Foursquare API in a Python Request.
Thru this way the most common venues will be examined and compared to each city.
